## [1.5.12] - 2025-10-23

### üé® New Features

#### Dashboard Customization

- **Section Visibility Toggle**: Added "Customize Dashboard" button with a visibility menu to show/hide individual dashboard sections
- **Persistent Layout**: Dashboard layout preferences are automatically saved to browser localStorage and restored on next session

#### Timezone Management
- **Timezone Selection**: New timezone picker in settings allowing users to select their local timezone
- **Schedule Accuracy**: Timezone selection ensures all schedule times and date-based prerolls are calculated correctly based on the user's location
- **Backend Support**: Full timezone-aware scheduling backend integration

### üîß UI/UX Improvements

#### Button Relocations
- **Dashboard Header Reorganization**: Moved "Customize Dashboard" button to dashboard header for better visibility and accessibility

- **Action Button Consolidation**: Streamlined action buttons for clearer user interactions

#### Visual Fixes
- **Dropdown Arrow Styling**: Fixed duplicate/misaligned dropdown arrows by correcting CSS background property usage
- **List View Background**: Restored missing background styling for preroll list views
- **Card Height Consistency**: Reduced dashboard card min-height from 200px to 140px for uniform card heights across all dashboard sections
- **Line Spacing Optimization**: Fixed Current Category card line spacing by implementing compact line-height (1.2) and reduced margins for better visual hierarchy
- **Dashboard Card Spacing**: Standardized paragraph spacing and margins across all dashboard cards for consistent appearance

#### Dashboard Updates
- **Genre Card Removal**: Removed "Recent Genres" card from default dashboard display for cleaner interface
- **Card Count**: Dashboard now displays 7 primary information cards instead of 8

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Preroll Management
