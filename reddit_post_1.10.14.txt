TITLE: [Release] NeXroll v1.10.14 - NeX-Up: Automatic Trailer Integration with Radarr/Sonarr

---

Hey r/PleX,

Just released v1.10.14 of NeXroll, my preroll manager for Plex. This update adds a feature I've been working on for a while: automatic trailer playback for upcoming movies and TV shows.

**What is NeXroll?**

NeXroll is a Windows app that manages Plex prerolls. You can organize prerolls into categories, schedule them by date/time/holiday, and automatically rotate what plays before your content.

**New in v1.10.14: NeX-Up**

The headline feature is NeX-Up - trailer integration with Radarr and Sonarr. Here's how it works:

1. Connect NeX-Up to your Radarr/Sonarr instances
2. It fetches upcoming releases within your configured timeframe
3. Trailers are automatically downloaded from YouTube
4. When you play something on Plex, you get a "Coming Soon" intro followed by trailers for upcoming content
5. Once the movie/show is added to your library, the trailer is automatically removed

**Dynamic Preroll Generator**

You can also generate custom "Coming Soon to [Your Server Name]" intro clips. There are several templates (Cinematic, Neon, Minimal, Retro, Elegant) and color themes to match your style. Everything generates locally using FFmpeg.

**Sequence Presets**

Pre-built sequences make setup easy:
- Coming Soon + Movie Trailers
- Coming Soon + TV Trailers
- Mixed: Movies + TV
- Theater Experience (intro + 4 trailers)

**Other Notable Additions**

- Video Quality Dashboard - See resolution breakdown of your preroll library
- Video Scaling - Batch convert prerolls to lower resolutions for better remote streaming
- Schedule Conflict Detection - Visual warnings when exclusive schedules overlap
- Improved Backup/Restore - Now includes database, videos, thumbnails, and settings

**YouTube Note**

YouTube has aggressive bot detection. If trailer downloads fail, try using a VPN with a fresh IP, or export cookies from an incognito browser session. The app includes guidance on this.
